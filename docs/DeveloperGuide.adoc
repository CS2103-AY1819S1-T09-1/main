By: `Team T09-1`      Since: `Aug 2018`      Licence: `MIT`

== Setting up

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `9`* or later
+
[WARNING]
JDK `10` on Windows will fail to run tests in <<UsingGradle#Running-Tests, headless mode>> due to a https://github.com/javafxports/openjdk-jfx/issues/66[JavaFX bug].
Windows developers are highly recommended to use JDK `9`.

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.

=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.
. Open link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/XmlAdaptedPerson.java[`XmlAdaptedPerson.java`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow.java`] and check for any code errors
.. Due to an ongoing https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-189060[issue] with some of the newer versions of IntelliJ, code errors may be detected even if the project can be built and run successfully
.. To resolve this, place your cursor over any of the code section highlighted in red. Press kbd:[ALT + ENTER], and select `Add '--add-modules=...' to module compiler options` for each error
. Repeat this for the test folder as well (e.g. check link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/commons/util/XmlUtilTest.java[`XmlUtilTest.java`] and link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/ui/HelpWindowTest.java[`HelpWindowTest.java`] for code errors, and if so, resolve it the same way)

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `seedu.address.MainApp` and try a few commands
. <<Testing,Run the tests>> to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

After setting up Travis, you can optionally set up coverage reporting for your team fork (see <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Coverage reporting could be useful for a team repository that hosts the final version but it is not that useful for your personal fork.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::Architecture.png[width="600"]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components. Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level.

* `EventsCenter` : This class (written using https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained[Google's Event Bus library]) is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design)
* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

.Class Diagram of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

[discrete]
==== Events-Driven nature of the design

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 1)
image::SDforDeletePerson.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the `Model` simply raises a `AddressBookChangedEvent` when the Address Book data are changed, instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

The diagram below shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 2)
image::SDforDeletePersonEventHandling.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct coupling between components.

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]

// tag::uiclassdiagram[]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

Additionally, the link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/CalendarPanel.java[`CalendarPanel`] consists of link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/CalendarHeaderCell.java[`CalendarHeaderCell`] to indicate days of week, link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/CalendarContentCell.java[`CalendarContentCell`] to indicate the date, and link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/CalendarTaskCard.java[`CalendarTaskCard`] for each of the tasks that falls on that date

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.
// end::uiclassdiagram[]

// tag::logiccomponent[]
[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `AppParser` class to parse the user command.
.  `AppParser` then sends the command to the appropriate module parser.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person) and/or raise events.
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("contacts delete 1")` API call.

=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores Person and Task data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` and `ObservableList<Task>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.
// end::modelcomponent[]

// tag::storage[]

=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Address Book data in xml format and read it back.

[NOTE]
`XmlAdaptedPerson` depends on `XmlAdaptedTaskId` to keep track of tasks assigned to the person. +
`XmlAdaptedTask` depends on `XmlAdaptedPersonId` to keep track of persons assigned to the task.
// end::storage[]

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::taskclass[]
=== Task class

.Structure of the Task class
image::TaskComponentClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

The `Task` class consists of list of `Tag` objects and a `Name` object, corresponding to the same classes in the `Person` namespace. It also has two `DateTime` objects, one for the start date and time and the other for the end date and time of the task.

The `DateTime` class encapsulates a Java `Calendar` object to store a date and time. It also includes methods to parse and validate date/time inputs from the user, and methods to return the date or time as a `String`.
// end::taskclass[]

// tag::addtasks[]
=== Addition of tasks
Adding a task is fairly straightforward. The user command is given to the parser, which validates the input and creates the task and the objects it is associated with. One aspect with a more involved implementation is the accomodation of optional start date and time fields in the user input, which is illustrated here.

.Interactions for derivation of start date and time from optional input in AddCommandParser
image::AddTaskSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

1. The `AddCommandParser` receives the input string and calls `ArgumentTokenizer.tokenize()` to create an `ArgumentMultiMap`.
2. It then creates a Date object for the current moment in time and uses the `INPUT_DATE_FORMAT` and `INPUT_TIME_FORMAT` `DateFormat` s in `DateTime` to parse the Date object into date and time strings in the correct format.
3. It then retrieves the start date and start time strings from `argMultiMap`, which returns an `Optional<String>` for each of them.
4. `orElse()` is then called on each `Optional<String>` to obtain the string encapsulated by the `Optional`, or the string for the current date/time if the `Optional` is empty.
5. Finally, `ParserUtil.parseDateTime()` is called with the resultant date and time strings.
// end::addtasks[]

// tag::listfindtasks[]
=== Listing and finding of tasks
==== Current Implementation

Listing and finding of tasks is facilitated by `ModelManager` and displayed through `TaskListPanel`.

`ModelManager` implements the following relevant methods:

* `ModelManager#updateFilteredTaskList(Predicate<Task> predicate)` --
Updates the the internal `filteredTasks` list with the predicate given. Exposed through the `Model` interface.
* `ModelManager#getFilteredTaskList()` -- Returns an unmodifiable view of the internal `filteredTasks` list that
updates with any changes to the baselist.
Exposed through the `Logic` and `Model` interfaces.

[NOTE]
`ModelManager#filteredTasks` is a JavaFX FilteredList around the unmodifiable list of tasks provided by `VersionedAddressBook#getTaskList())`. +


`TaskListPanel` is constructed with the JavaFX ObservableList returned by
`ModelManager#getFilteredTaskList()` when the application is started and displays it.

To find specific tasks, the appropriate predicate is passed into `ModelManager#updateFilteredTaskList()`, which updates
the `filteredTasks` list, propagating the change up to the `TaskListPanel` display.

.Filtering of Tasks in Model Component
image::TaskListFindModelSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

Currently, there are 2 use cases where `ModelManager#updateFilteredTaskList()` is called, examples are given below.

Case 1: On application startup or after running `tasks list` command

`ModelManager#updateFilteredTaskList()` is called with
`Model#PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_TASKS` which returns _true_ for all tasks.

.Sequence Diagram of Tasks List Command
image::TaskListLogicSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

Case 2: After running `tasks find [n/KEYWORD]... [sd/START_DATE] [ed/END_DATE] [t/TAG]…` command

`ModelManager#updateFilteredTaskList()` is called with predicate built by `TaskPredicateAssembler`
 which combines the different predicates from input.

[NOTE]
====
`TaskPredicateAssembler` combines the following predicates:

* `NameContainsKeywordsPredicate`: Returns true if tasks name contains any of the full keywords
* `MatchesStartDatePredicate`: Returns true if start date of task matches input
* `MatchesEndDatePredicate`: Returns true if end date of task matches input
* `HasTagsPredicate`: Returns true if task contains any of the specified tags
====

.Sequence Diagram of Tasks Find Command
image::TaskFindLogicSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

==== Design Considerations

The use of `ObservableList` and `FilteredList` from JavaFX saves us the trouble of handling task list updates.
Under this design, addition, updates and deletion of tasks will only need to interface with `VersionedAddressBook`,
and the lists for display will be updated through JavaFX.

If we were use Java Lists instead, events will need to be raised to update lists stored for display.

==== Future Enhancements

Currently, searching by task name only matches full keywords. In the future, part of words can be matched to
allow users to search with incomplete keywords.

// end::listfindtasks[]

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo feature
==== Current Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`.
It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()` -- Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()` -- Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()` -- Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

image::UndoRedoStartingStateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David ...` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial address book state, then there are no previous address book states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The `redo` command does the opposite -- it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone address book states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. We designed it this way because it no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David ...` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand4StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[width="650"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a list to store the history of address book states.
** Pros: Easy for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `VersionedAddressBook`.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate list, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things.
// end::undoredo[]

// tag::calendarshow[]
=== Calendar show feature
==== Current Implementation

The calendar show feature is facilitated by the `ModelManager`. It extends `ModelManager` with a calendar panel that allows the user to more easily view the tasks.

It exposes the following operations via the `Model` interface:

* `Model#updateCalendarMonth()` -- Saves the given calendar that encapsulates the month to be displayed in the calendar panel.
* `Model#getCalendarMonth()` -- Returns an `ObservableValue<Calendar>` for the calendar panel to identify which weekday the month begins with.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the calendar show mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application. The `MainWindow` class calls `Model#getCalendarMonth()` and `Model#getFilteredTaskList()` when creating the calendar panel. This initialises the calendar panel with an `ObservableList<Task>` and `ObservableValue<Calendar>` to allow it to perform UI updates when necessary.

Step 2. The calendar panel constructs a `GridPane` and initialises the cells with empty containers.

Step 3. The calendar panel registers listeners to the `ObservableValue<Calendar>` with a task that would empty grid cells and repopulate them with `ListView` elements that display the tasks starting on the corresponding dates.

Step 4. The user creates any number of tasks with start date in January 2018. The tasks will be stored appropriately.

Step 5. The user executes `calendars show y/2018 m/1`. The `calendars show` command calls `Model#updateCalendarMonth()`, listeners in the calendar panel to be notified of the changes.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Where to filter tasks by month for displaying in the calendar.

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Calendar object representing current month and full task list passed to calendar pane, all filter operations done in the calendar pane.
** Pros:
*** Less data duplication.
*** Allows effect of task filtering via the CLI to also be visible in the calendar view.
*** Allows display of tasks in adjacent months.
** Cons:
*** Slightly less efficient since each cell needs to filter the entire task list.
* **Alternative 1:** Done in the model
** Pros:
*** Application logic does not reside in the view layer.
** Cons:
*** Repeated filtering at multiple steps.
*** Task data is duplicated in multiple places.
*** Difficult to display events from adjacent months.

===== Aspect: Construction of grid cell.

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Delete and regenerate cell contents each time the month is changed
** Pros:
*** Ease of implementation.
** Cons:
*** Poorer performance, although this is insignificant since number of elements to be created/deleted is small and fixed.
* **Alternative 2:** Create and store `ListView` containers and reuse them.
** Pros:
*** Better performance, since deleting and recreating them incurs some computational cost.
** Cons:
*** There were some difficulties around creating a separate `UiPart` component that could be added as a child of a `VBox` element.

=== [Proposed] Data Encryption

_{Explain here how the data encryption feature will be implemented}_

// end::dataencryption[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

// tag::editdeletetasks[]
=== Editing and Deleting Tasks

The code for editing and deleting tasks is actually pretty similar to how it is implemented for persons. This is a combination of adding support for two additional commands: `tasks edit` and `tasks delete` inside `TasksParser`, defining `EditCommand` and `DeleteCommand` themselves, and finally, adding `void updateTask(Task target, Task editedTask);` and `void deleteTask(Task target);` in the `Model` interface, and implementing them in the `ModelManager` class.

After any task is updated/deleted, `indicateAddressBookChanged()` is called to fire off the event such that the UI is updated.

To explain more clearly, you can see below a diagram of what happens when the user asked the program to edit a task:

image:EditCommandParser.jpg[]

image:EditCommand.jpg[]

// end::editdeletetasks[]

// tag::assigning-tasks-and-contacts[]
=== Assigning tasks and contacts
==== Current implementation

Tasks and contacts can be assigned to each other using the commands `tasks assign` and `contacts assign`. This many-to-many relationship is stored simply as a list of task IDs and person IDs in the Person and Task classes respectively.

The commands are parsed by `AssignCommand` in both `TasksParser` and `ContactsParser`. If both the specified task and contact are found, the task and person IDs will be added to `Person.taskIds` and `Task.personIds` respectively, and the edited objects will be saved to disk. As happens when the edit commands are run, `indicateAddressBookChanged()` is called to update the UI. The data flow is similar to the one for `EditCommand` in the previous section.

An alternative implementation that was considered was to model the many-to-many relationship using an `Assignment` class, which will act like a join table in relational databases. This would have slightly decoupled the `Person` and `Task` classes. However, we chose not to implement it this way as a `Person` will always be assigned to a `Task`, and also because implementing such a relationship with manually managed IDs is extremely complex without a relational database to abstract away the complexity.

==== Future Enhancements

Both implementations of `AssignCommand` are almost identical, and should be refactored.

Currently, assignments cannot be removed. The commands that will perform this task, `tasks unassign` and `contacts unassign`, are both slated to be implemented in v1.3.
// end::assigning-tasks-and-contacts[]

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

Each `.adoc` file may also specify some file-specific https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#attributes[asciidoc attributes] which affects how the file is rendered.

Asciidoctor's https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#builtin-attributes[built-in attributes] may be specified and used as well.

[TIP]
Attributes left unset in `.adoc` files will use their *default value*, if any.

=== Site Template

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/stylesheets[`docs/stylesheets`] are the https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS[CSS stylesheets] of the site.
You can modify them to change some properties of the site's design.

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] controls the rendering of `.adoc` files into HTML5.
These template files are written in a mixture of https://www.ruby-lang.org[Ruby] and http://slim-lang.com[Slim].

[WARNING]
====
Modifying the template files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] requires some knowledge and experience with Ruby and Asciidoctor's API.
You should only modify them if you need greater control over the site's layout than what stylesheets can provide.
The SE-EDU team does not provide support for modified template files.

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.address.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.address.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `HelpWindow.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Coverage Reporting

We use https://coveralls.io/[Coveralls] to track the code coverage of our projects. See <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>> for more details.

=== Documentation Previews
When a pull request has changes to asciidoc files, you can use https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify] to see a preview of how the HTML version of those asciidoc files will look like when the pull request is merged. See <<UsingNetlify#, UsingNetlify.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Address Book depends on the http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome[Jackson library] for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives. +
a. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size) +
b. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)
