== PROJECT: Cow

---

== Overview

Cow is a group project task manager aimed at students. Its main features include individual task management, and project groupmate management and task assignment. It is a desktop application with a command line interface, which is also further enhanced by a graphical user interface created with JavaFX.

Cow was developed in 2018 by a team of https://cs2103-ay1819s1-t09-1.github.io/main/AboutUs.html[5 undergraduate students] as part of a software engineering module. This personal project portfolio documents my contributions to Cow. Cow is written in Java, and has about 15 kLoC.

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to assign and unassign tasks to groupmates*.
** What it does: allows the user to assign a task to a contact and vice versa, and unassign them from each other.
** Justification: This is a key feature for students who manage group projects, as they need to keep track of everyone's tasks and ensure that their projects will be completed on time.
** Highlights: This enhancement required the implementation of a many-to-many relationship without a relational database. This was challenging as it required changes to some core components of the app, and thus resulted in many code changes throughout the codebase.

* *Minor enhancement*: added unique identifiers to contacts and tasks so that Cow is able to identify tasks and contacts between edits, and also to differentiate between nearly-identical tasks and people.

== PROJECT: ShowFace

During the same semester that I worked on Cow, I was also developing https://showface.io[ShowFace.io], a React web app that allows groups to find the best time to meet. In this project, I was the lead developer, delivering features nearly every day.
