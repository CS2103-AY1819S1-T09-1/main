== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to edit, delete and batch delete tasks*
** What it does: allows the user to change tasks as well as delete more than one tasks at a time
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because sometimes user may add duplicate tasks or add tasks with wrong details. Moreover, sometimes a user may need to delete more than one tasks at a time. Instead of doing it one-by-one which is time consuming, they can do it in one command instead.
** Highlights: This enhancement was built such that the syntax is the same as the ones for contacts. Moreover, the batch delete tasks syntax is also built on top of the original single delete command. Efforts were taken to ensure that code duplication remains minimum between delete and batch delete.

* *Minor enhancement*: added a history command that allows the user to navigate to previous commands using up/down keys.

* *Code contributed*: TBC
