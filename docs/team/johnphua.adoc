== PROJECT: Cow

This document serves to provide an introduction to the project and my contributions to it.

== Overview

Cow is a desktop task manager with project management capabilities, powered by a command-line interface.
It is written in Java by a team of 4 undergraduates from the NUS School of Computing.

The list of features include:

* Management of tasks
* Management of contacts
* Assigning of tasks to contacts
* Calendar view of tasks

== Summary of contributions

* *Major feature*: Finding of tasks by name, date and tags
** Purpose: Allowing users to efficiently search for tasks
** Value to project: Allowing users to sieve through their long list of tasks
** Highlights: This feature was built to be flexible according to the users needs. Users are able to combine different
search criteria to make their search more specific. This required the design of new class that can accept and
compound different search criteria together.

* *Minor enhancement*: added a history command that allows the user to navigate to previous commands using up/down keys.

* *Code contributed*: [https://github.com[Functional code]] [https://github.com[Test code]] _{give links to collated code files}_
